#Computer stuff I want to buy or need to research

##Storage
-  A [Drobo Mini](http://www.amazon.com/Drobo-4-bay-Storage-Array-Thunderbolt/dp/B008MH1KHA/ref=sr_1_4?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1414955346&sr=1-4&keywords=drobo) sounds great, but it's too expensive at the moment. 
    -  However, it uses [2.5" drives and has Thunderbolt](http://drobo.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/downloads/products/0520_DroboMini_DS.pdf)
    +  [Picking Drobo Drives by application](http://www.drobo.com/storage-products/choose-drive/)
-  The [Transporter Sync Private Cloud](http://www.amazon.com/Drobo-CTP1D99US1R-Transporter-Private-Cloud/dp/B00G23HHXM/ref=pd_sim_pc_2?ie=UTF8&refRID=0F9GHVX34KN88HJB421Q) seems interesting, but requires a wired internet connection
    +  [This version](http://www.amazon.com/Drobo-CTR1D99US1R-Transporter-Private-Cloud/dp/B00BFNJ2NW) has a USB port for a WiFi adapter.

-  [OWC](https://eshop.macsales.com/shop/firewire/) is always a good place to look.
    +  I've wanted a [Mercury On-The-Go Pro](https://eshop.macsales.com/shop/firewire/on-the-go) for awhile.

##Deferred Purchases
Stuff I'd like, but can't worry about now (2014-12-16)

-  [G-Boom](http://gprojectgear.com/products/g-boom)
    +  Any of their speakers should work. Sherman at the Lab has a G-Go.

##Windows-specific issues
