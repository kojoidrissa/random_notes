-  [Technical interview at Amazon (SDE) and Microsoft (Program Manager)](http://blog.mattgoyer.com/technical-interview-at-amazon-sde-and-microsoft-program-manager/)
    +  Exec Summary: Interviewing is time consuming, tiring, and a lot of work. But the reward for doing well is a full time job. Treat the whole process as a game and have a good time. And donâ€™t give up. It took me a long time to get an interview with Amazon and I have failed at the Microsoft interview process before so keep at it.
