#Tiny House Notes
How did I NOT have a file like this already?

I'm creating this file for two reasons

1. I'm interested in tiny houses, small living spaces and the various options and flexibility they provide. I like the money SAVING aspect, as well as the finanicail flexibility they can provide. I also like the ability to customize things, so your house fits YOU.
2. I think tiny homes could be my entry point into (building) architecture, which my help me better grok (software) architecture and patterns. It may also help me with design thinking and my general making skills.
    3. On this topic, I wonder what the options are to design, then 3D print models of homes or structures? So, if I wanted to layout a tiny house, how difficult would it be to model, 3D print, then assemble it? I'll have to ask at the Lab.
