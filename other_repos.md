#Other Repos
A list of Github (and perhaps other) repos that I want to look into. I'm listing them here until I'm ready to start actively working on or contributing to them. That'll help keep MY account 'clean'.

-  [Raspberry Pi Documentation](https://github.com/raspberrypi/documentation)
-  [OpenHatch Mainline](https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline)
-  [TX/RX site](https://github.com/chriscauley/txrx.org)
-  [Code for America API](https://github.com/codeforamerica/cfapi)
-  [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons.html)
    +  This page links to the current (as of 2015-03-30; v. 5.3) versions of the SC lessons. They're no longer updating the repo I'd forked. The page linked above has links to the repos for the various lessons.

-  [Python Web Sockets](https://github.com/pizzapanther/Python-Web-Sockets): Paul Bailey's PyWebHou presentation on Web Sockets. I need to review his presentation and look at this code.
-  Personal Goals: [Jeff](https://github.com/jefftriplett/personal-goals), but he forked it from [Una](https://github.com/una/personal-goals), who I've heard on an episode of the CodeNewbies podcast.

##DjangoGirls
