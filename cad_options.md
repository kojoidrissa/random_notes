#CAD software options
##NOTE: Combine this with the [3D_printing.md] file in this repo
-  [FreeCAD](http://www.freecadweb.org); FLOSS [parametric modeling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_model) software. I've got a PACKT book on this, [`FreeCAD[HOWTO]`](http://www.amazon.com/FreeCAD-How-Daniel-Falck/dp/1849518866). It's got TERRIBLE reviews on Amazon and Chris Kelley hates it. But the ebook was SUPER cheap (esp. at 60% off) and it's got a Python API. So, I'll give it a look.
    +  It could also be a project I [contribute](http://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Help_FreeCAD) to.
+  [Blender](http://www.blender.org): Open-Source 3D modeling software scriptable in Python
    *  [3D printing toolkit](http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.6/Py/Scripts/Modeling/PrintToolbox)
    *  [Google Search: "blender python 3d printing" ](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=blender+python+3d+printing&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)
    *  [PyCon 2015 Talk: "3D Print Anything with the Blender API"](https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/352/)
        -  Reading that description tells me Blender's Python API must be fairly awesome
        -  Same speaker is also doing [Intro to 3D Graphics with Blender and the Blender API](https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/307/)
