#Various notes on deploying web apps

##Flask Trouble
While trying to deploy Flask on WebFaction (to test Twilio), I found the following tutorials:

-  http://aaronpresley.com/deploying-a-flask-project-on-webfaction/
-  The [Flask tutorial](http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/65/) (suggested by Twilio)

BOTH of these seemed to diverge, where one would've expected two tutorials with the same end goal to CONVERGE. I couldn't get them to work, but what do you expect when you mix and match. There are clearly things I don't understand about deployment. But after 3-4 hours of no results, I need to move on.

BUT! This [scp tutorial](http://www.hypexr.org/linux_scp_help.php) was helpful, just in general. I hated using nano on the remote host.
